\section intro_sec Introduction
 
    MYCrypto is a set of Objective-C cryptography classes for Cocoa applications on Mac OS X and iPhone.
    
    <a href="annotated.html">Browse the class documentation.</a>
 
\section license License
 
 MYCrypto is released under a BSD license, which means you can freely use it in open-source
 or commercial projects, provided you give credit in your documentation or About box.
   
\section config Configuration
 
    MYCrypto requires Mac OS X 10.5 or later, since it uses Objective-C 2 features like
    properties and for...in loops.
 
    MYCrypto uses my <a href="/hg/hgwebdir.cgi/MYUtilities">MYUtilities</a> library. You'll need to have downloaded that library, and added
    the necessary source files and headers to your project. See the MYCrypto Xcode project,
    which contains the minimal set of MYUtilities files needed to build MYUtilities. (That project
    has its search paths set up to assume that MYUtilities is in a directory next to MYCrypto.)

\section download How To Get It

    <ul>
    <li><a href="/hg/hgwebdir.cgi/MYCrypto/archive/tip.zip">Download the current source code</a>
    <li>To check out the source code using <a href="http://selenic.com/mercurial">Mercurial</a>:
    \verbatim hg clone /hg/hgwebdir.cgi/MYCrypto/ MYCrypto \endverbatim
    <li>As described above, you'll also need to download or check out <a href="/hg/hgwebdir.cgi/MYUtilities">MYUtilities</a> and put it in 
    a directory next to MYCrypto.
    </ul>
